//This program informs users about the upcoming promotional sale on a particular item. It has a string template, which relies on the discountPercentage variable for the percent discount and the item variable for the item on sale. However, there are compilation errors in the code.

    println(offer)
} 
Can you figure out the root cause of the errors and fix them?
Can you determine the output of this program before you run the code in Kotlin Playground?*/
